1,Gender,"Where we can calculate the paygap between females and non-females, we find that the females generally earn less in similar roles and similar grades.",Check the gender-paygap table and identify the grade/role combinations where an the paygap has most stars. Check if the salary differences are justified.
2,Age,The team is predominantly younger than the surrounding population (Poland).,Consider hiring older people to balance. Focus on retention.
3,Gender,"The diversity is good in grade 1 and 2, but under par in grade 3",Consider if females have barriers to apply to grade 3 jobs and remove the barriers.
4,Gender,Males in Grade 2 seem to have been promoted faster.,"Understand unconscious bias, coach everyone (and specially females), work on trust."
