Overview {.storyboard}

### Welcome! The Particular Example Behind this Demo Report


The data used for this report is randomly generated with the following characteristics:

-   team size: `r teamSize`
-   percentage of females: `r pctFemales`
-   average male's salary / average female's salary: `r maleSalaryBias`
- no other biases are built in (so any other observations stem from random generation of data. This can be seen as "despite no bias against citizenship by the manager, some pay-gaps will be different from one." This means that being unbiased is not necessarily the same as having equal outcomes.)

#### Equitable outcomes are not the same as equal outcomes!

### Findings: Salaries of females is systhematically lower than males in this young team. Consider also the following findings.

```{r findings}
f1 <- tibble(Nbr = 1, 
             Area = "Gender", 
             Finding = "Where we can calculate the paygap between females and non-females, we find that the females generally earn less in similar roles and similar grades.", 
             Suggestion = "Check the gender-paygap table and identify the grade/role combinations where an the paygap has most stars. Check if the salary differences are justified.")
f2 <- tibble(Nbr = 2, 
             Area = "Age", 
             Finding = "The team is predominantly younger than the surrounding population (Poland).", 
             Suggestion = "Consider hiring older people to balance. Focus on retention.")
f3 <- tibble(Nbr = 3, 
             Area = "Gender", 
             Finding = "The diversity is good in grade 1 and 2, but under par in grade 3", 
             Suggestion = "Consider if females have barriers to apply to grade 3 jobs and remove the barriers.")
f4 <- tibble(Nbr = 4, 
             Area = "Gender", 
             Finding = "Males in Grade 2 seem to have been promoted faster.", 
             Suggestion = "Understand unconscious bias, coach everyone (and specially females), work on trust.")
findings <- rbind(f1, f2, f3, f4)
colnames(findings) <- c("Nbr", "Area", "Finding", "Suggestion")

knitr::kable(findings) %>% #column_spec(3:4, width = "12em")
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

### Furher information  {.tabset}


#### Legends

-   `paygap` = the ratio of median salaries of one group divided by the median of the salaries of the other group
-   \{Gray}{`NA`} = numbers are too small, please look at individuals;
-   \colorbox{green}{nothing} = no bias detectable;
-   \colorbox{GreenYellow}{`.`} = maybe there is some bias, but the numbers are low, check individuals;
-   \colorbox{Yellow}{`*`} = you should check for bias;
-   \colorbox{BurntOrange}{`**`} = bias is probably there;
-   \colorbox{red}{`***`} = most certainly there is bias

So, there will be more stars if the probability of a bias is higher: this can be due to a higher bias and/or due to a larger sample size.

\small

 - `grade` = the salary grade as used in the company
 - `jobID` = a unique identifier of the job category (can be abbreviated)
 - `sal_F` = the median salary of the females (F)
 - `sal_oth` = the median salary of the other groups (non F). The tool is open to use more than one gender.
 - `age_F` = the median age of the females (or `age_Pol` could be the median age of the team members with Polish citizenship)
 - `age_oth` = the median age of the other groups take together (e.g. the median age of non females)
 - `paygap` = the ratio of median salary earned by the selected group (e.g. females) divided by the median of the other people. If this is lower than $1$, then median female earns less than the median non-female.
 - `conf.` = the confidence level that this paygap is significant.


#### index

Info The diversity indexes show how diverse our workforce is. They are calculated similar to entropy: $I = -\frac{1}{\log(N)} \sum_i^N {p_i \log p_i}$, where there are $N$ possible and mutually exclusive states $i$. They range from $0$ to $1$.



Gender  {.storyboard}
======================================

### The gender diversity decreases systhematically for higher grades

```{r, fig.cap="The diversity of the team with respect to gender per grade.\\label{fig:gender-gauge}"}
t <- table(d$gender, d$grade)
t1 <- apply(t, 2, diversity, prior = c(50.2, 49.8))
t2 <- tibble(value = t1, label = paste("Grade", names(t1)))
div_gauge_plot(t2, ncol = 3)
```

### The distribution of paygap. All paygaps, however go in the same direction. This is not good and needs to be addressed.
```{r paygapDist}
div_plot_paygap_distribution(pg_gender$data$paygap, label = "Gender")
```


### The line-by-line paygap information reveals the places where ACTION is needed.

```{r parsePaygapGender, echo=FALSE}
div_parse_paygap(pg_gender)
```


### Boxplots for salary show another view on the paygap. The box in the barplot shows the bulkd of the observations (second and third quartile) and the line in its middle is the median.
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=gender, y=salary, fill=gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(grade ~ jobID, scales="free_y") +
  ggtitle('The salary gap per salary grade (level in the company)')
ggplotly(p1)
```


### Job Changes per Year per Gender

```{r TenureJob, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Job changes per year indicate mobility and risk taking. They are a good indication for promotion (see Figure \\ref{fig:prom_p_gender})."}
ylim1 = boxplot.stats(1/d$tenure_job)$stats[c(1, 5)]
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=gender, y=1/tenure_job, fill=gender)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~grade) + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim = ylim1*1.05)
p
```

### Promotions per Year per Gender

```{r TenureGrade, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The number of promotions per year can show if a gender is more probable to be promoted.\\label{fig:prom_p_gender}"}
ylim1 = boxplot.stats(1/d$tenure_job)$stats[c(1, 5)]
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=gender, y=1/tenure_grade, fill=gender)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~grade) + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim = ylim1*1.05)
p
```


### Conclusions for gender diversity and inclusion -- the main findings are:
```{r genderConclusions}
findings %>% filter(Area == "Gender") %>%
  select(-c(Area))       %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```


Age   {.storyboard}
=====================================

### The team is relatively young when we compare with the general surrounding population.

```{r ageism, fig.cap="The diversity of the team with respect to age, assuming the age distribution of the country as reference.\\label{fig:ageism}"}
# ages in Poland
p1 <- div_gauge_plot(tbl_age_div)
t <- rbind(ad, ageRef)
rownames(t) <- c("team", "reference")
#knitr::kable(round(t,2), 
#             caption = "The percentages of different age groups in this team compared to the population of Poland. An equal distribution would yield a diversity of 1.\\label{tab:div:age}")

t2 <- t %>% t() %>% 
  as_tibble %>%
  mutate(age_group = rownames(t(t))) %>%
  as_tibble %>% gather("population", "percentage", 1:2)

p2 <- ggplot(t2, aes(x = age_group, y = percentage, fill = population)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",  position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(percentage,2)), vjust=1.6, color="black", position = position_dodge(0.9), size=3.5) + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2, widths = 1:2)

```


### The distribution of age paygap reveals no systhematic bias.
```{r paygapAgeDist}
div_plot_paygap_distribution(pg_age$data$paygap, label = "Age")
```



### The Age Paygap details reveal one grade/job where we might want to check.
```{r agePaygap, echo=FALSE}
pg_age %>% div_parse_paygap
```



### Conclusions for age diversity and inclusion -- the main findings are:
```{r ageConclusions}
findings %>% filter(Area == "Age") %>%
  select(-c(Area))       %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```


Citizenship   {.storyboard}
==========================

### Most people are Polish
```{r nationalities, fig.height = 6,fig.cap = c("The barplot for the nationalities in the team over all grades.")}
#t <- table(d$citizenship, d$grade)
t <- d                     %>% 
     group_by(citizenship) %>% 
     summarise(n = n())    %>%
     arrange(desc(n))      %>%
     ggplot( aes(x = citizenship, y = n))    +
        geom_col(aes(fill = n), width = 0.7) +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5),
              axis.title.x=element_blank())
              
t
```

### No anomalies can be detected for the distribution per grade
```{r nationalities2, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = c("The breakdown of each grade per nationalitiy.")}
t <- d                            %>% 
     group_by(citizenship, grade) %>% 
     summarise(n = n())           %>%
     ggplot( aes(x = grade, y = n))                +
        geom_col(aes(fill = n), width = 0.7)       +
        facet_wrap(~ citizenship, scales="free_y") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5),
                axis.title.x=element_blank())

t
```


### The distribution of citizen paygap reveals no systhematic bias.
```{r paygapCitizenshipDist}
div_plot_paygap_distribution(pg_citizenship$data$paygap, label = "Citizenship")
```



### The Citizenship PayGap: no actions needed.

```{r parsePaygapCitizenship, echo=FALSE}
div_parse_paygap(pg_citizenship)
```

### The distribution of Tenure in the Company paygap reveals no systhematic bias.
```{r paygapTenureFirmDist}
div_plot_paygap_distribution(pg_tenure_firm$data$paygap, label = "Tenure in the Firm")
```
